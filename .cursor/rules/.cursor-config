- You have the permission to scan the entire codebase.
- Work in a non-destructive way.
- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible — check for similar existing logic before writing new.
- Be mindful of different environments: dev and prod.
- Make only requested or clearly relevant changes.
- If replacing a pattern or tech, fully remove the old one after confirming the new works.
- Keep the codebase clean, well-organized, and concise.
- Refactor any file that exceeds 300 lines.
- Mock data only in unit tests — never in dev/prod logic.
- Never add stubbing, fake logic, or placeholder values in environments that affect users.
- Never overwrite .env files unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not start or restart frontend/backend servers in the terminal without approval.
- Do not push code to Git or deploy without confirmation.
- If you update the frontend, run `npm run build` to check for unused code or issues.
